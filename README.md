## How to use [Important]
- The training data this model was tested with can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery
- This is meant to run on consumer laptops just for educational purposes, hence the quality of images is cropped to 64x64 in pre processing

## Features

* **Custom Dataset & Augmentation:** Flexible PyTorch Dataset with random flips, rotations, and resizing
* **DCGAN Architecture:** ConvTranspose layers with BatchNorm, LeakyReLU, and Tanh for stable image generation
* **Latent Space Exploration:** Maps random vectors to realistic images
* **Training Stability:** Separate optimizers for Generator and Discriminator, Adam with β1=0.5, real/fake label handling
* **Progress Tracking:** Fixed noise vectors allow monitoring Generator improvements over epochs
* **Real-Time Visualization:** Matplotlib previews generated images during training
* **GPU Acceleration:** Automatically uses CUDA if available for faster training
* **Modular & Configurable:** Easily adjust batch size, epochs, image size, and save intervals
